Together with the [Blango Lab](https://blangolab.com/) we enjoyed a social day out where we hiked to the Leuchenburg castle and rewarded ourselves with a picnic and a visit to a beer garden (and ice cream). :stuffed_flatbread: :plate_with_cutlery: :watermelon: :beer: :icecream: 

Here are a few photos from the day:
