The lab's first goodbyes! :smiling_face_with_tear:

Fabulous technician Peggy left the group for a position in industry. 

Microbiome expert Hsinyu submitted her MS thesis and moved back to Taiwan to put her skills to use analyzing microbiomes for a company.

And welcome to visiting PhD student John who joins us for three months from the group of [Neta Shlezinger](https://www.shlezingerlab.com/) (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel) to learn how to analyze fungal genome data.
