Welcome to Hsinyu Lin and Adam Ryan! Hsinyu will be doing her Master's thesis in the group and learning to analyse mycobiome data. 

And an additional welcome to Adam Ryan, a visiting doctoral researcher from the group of [Geraldine Butler](https://people.ucd.ie/gbutler) (University College Dublin). Adam is doing a research stay in the group and leveraging our expertise in the construction of fungal pangenomes.
