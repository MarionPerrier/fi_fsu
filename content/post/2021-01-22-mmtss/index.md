The [Medical Mycology Trainee Seminar Series](https://medicine.utah.edu/pathology/microbiology-immunology/mmtss/) is a newly launched platform that allows new faculty, postdocs, and PhD students a platform to present their work virtually to the global medical mycology community. Amelia Barber (Leibniz-HKI, Jena, Germany) and José Vargas-Muñiz (SIU, Carbondale, IL, USA) gave the inaugural lectures in what promises to be a great seminar series.  

Many thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to present our work on ***Searching for the source: how environmental fungi become clinically resistant***.  

Video of the presentations can be watched below.
