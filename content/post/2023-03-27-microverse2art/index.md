The group put coding aside for an evening to explore their artistic talents. The goal here was to decorate our new building with some painting that could represent our home in the Excellence Cluster, Balance of the Microverse. Each member was assigned a letter the task of making a painting that represted the letter and anything from their working day or life in the Microverse cluster.

Brushes :paintbrush:, paints :art:, glitter :sparkles:, music :notes:, drinks :beer: and food :ramen: packed the night and made room for masterpieces :artist:.

The whole Rosalind-Franklin-Stra√üe team (Fungal Informatics + Viral Ecology and Omics) contributed canvases and proudly posed for this snapshot of our macroverse.

Fungi, bacteria and phages were the main characters in the art. In addition, people explored the bioinformatic context, experimental setings, connectivity, modelling and chemical coumpounds. Thanks to everyone's creativity, this is what the entrance to our office looks like now!
