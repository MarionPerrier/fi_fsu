The migratory Phillip Brassington is a doctoral researcher focusing on how to simplify the process of typing a fungal pathogen. 

Native to New Zealand, he completed his biological bachelor's in California, and his biomedical master's in northern Germany. Between degrees, he spent two years at Hammersmith Medicines Research in London as a clinical studies and laboratory technician. When not at work, he is usually found reading, hiking, dabbling in storytelling, hobby coding, or occasionally enjoying a night with friends.
