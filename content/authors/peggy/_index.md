Native to Greece, Peggy received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of Thessaly. After her studies, she moved to the Netherlands where she worked as a Research Technician at the Hubrecht Institute for three years. There, she helped to develop a differentiation protocol to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into insulin-producing (β-like) cells for the treatment of Diabetes Type 1. After starting PhD at the University Hospital Jena working on a lung-on-a-chip infection model, she decided she preferred to use her excellent skills as a research technician. 

In the group, she contributes to the research activities of the lab and is in charge of laboratory organization.  When not in the lab, Peggy likes doing sports, traveling, reading, and hanging out with friends.
