Marion Perrier is a PhD student working with the transcriptome of Aspergillus fumigatus, with a deeper focus on its pathogenicity and antifungal resistance. Coming from France, she obtained her bachelor in biochemistry, molecular biology and microbiology in 2018, and graduated in 2020 from a Bioinformatics mastery in the south of France. Then, she worked as a bioinformatician engineer in the Toulouse cancer research centre for two years, where she mainly analysed various transcriptomics data and developed a new single-cell visualization tool. Outside of the lab, she enjoy roller skating, playing music instruments, playing board games with friends and occasionally reading about exobiology.
